### \* Please note that our load distribution was such that even if a teammate could not do the work he was assigned, other teammates who depended on his work had documentation tasks assigned. So no user was significantly blocked. This can also be seen from our near-ideal burndown chart. Yet if there has been an issue, we have repoted the same in this Journal
