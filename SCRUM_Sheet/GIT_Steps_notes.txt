1. After cloning master branch go to the main branch using
# git checkout main

2. Verify whether you are on main branch
# git branch

2. Then based on your name create a new branch in this main branch
# git checkout -b swapnil/Create_SCRUM_Sheet

3. Add your code to this branch ; its visible in the git command code like this
16692@DESKTOP-LC9P1LK MINGW64 /d/SJSU/NEW_SEM/202/Project/fa20-cmpe-202-sec-02-team-project-team_3 
(swapnil/Create_SCRUM_Sheet)

# git add .

4. Then commit and push in that particular branch

# git commit -m "Issue name"
# git push origin swapnil/Create_SCRUM_Sheet

5. Once this is done go to your github code page and you will have a branch merge notification on the top click it 
and it will add the new pull request.Issue with our repo is that Prof. is the owner. So we cannot change the default merge branch which is master. 
So every time we merge a pull request, goto the pull request. Edit it change the merge branch at the top.
we need to specify in the GUI where to merge. Then merge.

6. On review in the weekly meeting we can merge the branch to the main and delete the branch ending the Sprint for that
issue.

7. All new issues will be created by the SCRUM master and will be merged by the SCRUM master. Pull request and 
code commits needs to be done by the individual users. If you wish to create sub issues we can just modify existing 
issues and new ones to make the sub-division.


8. How to merge branches?
1) Go to source branch
# git checkout "source branch"

2) update locally source branch
# git pull origin "source branch"

3) go to destination branch
# git checkout "destination branch"

4) update destination branch
# git pull origin "destination branch"

5) merge source branch
# git merge "source branch"
